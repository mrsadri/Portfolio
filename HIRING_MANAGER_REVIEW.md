## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. **Hero Section - Weak Value Proposition** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Issues:**
- "an impact-oriented Product Designer" - generic, doesn't differentiate
- "6+ years of experience" - doesn't convey seniority level
- Missing key differentiators visible elsewhere (Trust & Safety expertise, scale, mentorship)

**Recommendation:**
```
Current: "an impact-oriented Product Designer with 6+ years of experience, enhancing experiences for 40 million active users"

Better: "Senior Product Designer specializing in Trust & Safety and Growth at scale. I've protected 2.1M+ users from harassment, doubled revenue for telecom products, and built design systems used by 8,300+ designers."

Even Better: Lead with your unique value:
"Senior Product Designer | Trust & Safety & Growth at Scale
Protecting users, driving revenue, and building systems that scale"
```

**Why:** Hiring managers scan hero sections in 3-5 seconds. You need to immediately communicate:
- Seniority level
- Specialization/niche
- Scale/impact
- Unique value

### 2. **Missing "Why Hire Me" Section** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Current:** No dedicated section explaining what makes you a strong senior hire

**Recommendation:** Add a section after hero (before case studies) with:
- **What I Bring:** 3-4 key differentiators
  - Trust & Safety expertise at scale (rare skill)
  - Cross-functional leadership (design, legal, engineering)
  - Design system thinking (8.3K+ users)
  - Teaching/mentorship (200+ designers)
- **What I'm Looking For:** Brief statement about ideal role/company
- **Quick Stats:** Visual cards showing scale, impact, experience

### 3. **Resume Page Not Prominent Enough** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current:** Resume is buried in navigation; many hiring managers want PDF immediately

**Recommendation:**
- Add prominent "Download Resume" button in hero section
- Make resume page more scannable (currently good but could be faster)
- Add "Quick Facts" section at top of resume page

### 4. **Case Studies - Missing Context** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current:** Case studies are excellent but missing:
- Company context (what is Divar? What is Setare Aval?)
- Team size/structure
- Your specific role vs. team contribution

**Recommendation:** Add brief company/context section at start of each case study

## 💡 STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. **Information Architecture - Reorder for Hiring Managers**

**Current Flow:**
Hero → Metrics → Case Studies → Experiences → Contact

**Better Flow for Hiring:**
1. **Hero** (with stronger value prop)
2. **Why Hire Me** (NEW - key differentiators)
3. **Case Studies** (keep depth)
4. **Experience Timeline** (quick scan)
5. **Skills & Tools** (NEW - dedicated section)
6. **Contact** (keep)

**Why:** Hiring managers want to quickly assess:
1. Are they senior enough? (Hero + Why Hire Me)
2. Can they solve our problems? (Case Studies)
3. Do they have the right experience? (Timeline)
4. Do they know our tools? (Skills)
5. How do I contact them? (Contact)

### 2. **Add Skills/Tools Section to Home Page**

**Current:** Skills only visible on resume page

**Recommendation:** Add compact skills section showing:
- Research & Strategy (usability testing, competitive analysis)
- Design (systems, UI, prototyping)
- Technical (Figma, data analysis, BI tools)
- Leadership (mentorship, cross-functional collaboration)

**Why:** Many hiring managers check tool proficiency early

### 3. **Strengthen "Experiences" Section**

**Current:** Shows teaching and design system, but could be stronger

**Recommendation:**
- Add more context about impact
- Show how teaching/mentorship translates to leadership
- Add metrics where possible (e.g., "200+ designers → 85% job placement rate")

### 4. **Contact Page - Add "What I'm Looking For"**

**Current:** Generic "Let's Work Together" message

**Recommendation:** Add section explaining:
- Types of roles you're interested in
- Company size/stage preferences
- What you bring to a team
- Availability/timeline

**Why:** Helps hiring managers self-select and shows intentionality

### 5. **Add Testimonials/References Section**

**Current:** References only in "My Story" page

**Recommendation:** 
- Extract key quotes from references
- Add testimonials section to home page or resume
- Show social proof from colleagues/managers

**Why:** Third-party validation is powerful for hiring decisions

## 📊 CONTENT IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. **Hero Section Copy**

**Current:**
```
"an impact-oriented Product Designer with 6+ years of experience, enhancing experiences for 40 million active users"
```

**Recommended Options:**

**Option A (Trust & Safety Focus):**
```
"Senior Product Designer | Trust & Safety at Scale
Protecting 2.1M+ users from harassment, building secure experiences, and leading cross-functional safety initiatives"
```

**Option B (Growth Focus):**
```
"Senior Product Designer | Growth & Retention
Doubling revenue, improving conversion funnels, and building design systems used by 8,300+ designers"

6+ years designing for 40M+ users at Divar and Setare Aval. Specializing in safety-critical products, revenue growth, and scalable design systems."
```

### 2. **Metrics Section - Add Context**

**Recommendation:**
- Add brief "how" context under each metric
- Group by category (Safety, Growth, Community)

### 3. **Case Study Summaries - Strengthen**

**Current:** Good but could be more compelling

**Recommendation:**

**Current:** Text-heavy hero

**Recommendation:**
- Add visual elements (badges, icons) for key skills

**Current:** Good depth but dense

**Recommendation:**
- Add "TL;DR" section at top of each case study
- Use more visual breaks
- Add "Key Achievements" callout box

### 4. **Mobile Experience**

**Current:** Responsive but could optimize for mobile hiring managers
