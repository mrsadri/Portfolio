## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. **Hero Section - Value Proposition** ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Updated to "an impact-oriented Senior Product Designer" (seniority now clear)
- ✅ Subtitle added: "Former iOS developer turned designer, building data-driven experiences that drive user retention and business growth for 40+ million users across B2B and B2C products"
- ⚠️ Could be stronger - still somewhat generic compared to recommendations

**Current Implementation:**
```
Title: "an impact-oriented Senior Product Designer"
Subtitle: "Former iOS developer turned designer, building data-driven experiences that drive user retention and business growth for 40+ million users across B2B and B2C products"
```

**Recommendation for Further Improvement:**
- Consider adding more specific differentiators (Trust & Safety, scale metrics)
- Could emphasize unique value more prominently
- Add resume download button in hero section (see #3)

**Why:** Hiring managers scan hero sections in 3-5 seconds. Current version is better but could be more impactful.

### 2. **"Why Hire Me" Section** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fully implemented section after hero

**Implementation Details:**
- ✅ **What I Bring:** 6 differentiators displayed in carousel format:
  - AI-Familiar & Technical (former iOS developer)
  - Data-Driven Decision Making (170-hour data analyst course)
  - User Retention Expertise at Scale (40M+ users)
  - Teaching & Mentorship Leadership (200+ students, 3 years)
  - Cross-Product Experience (B2C & B2B)
  - Adaptable to Any Team Structure
- ✅ **What I'm Looking For:** Statement about ideal role with link to resume
- ✅ **Quick Stats:** Visual cards showing:
  - 40M+ Unique Users
  - 200+ Students Mentored
  - 3 Years Teaching Experience
  - B2C & B2B Product Experience

**Status:** Excellent implementation. Section is well-positioned and comprehensive.

### 3. **Resume Page Prominence** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Resume link present in main navigation
- ❌ No prominent "Download Resume" button in hero section
- ⚠️ Resume page scannability - needs review
- ❌ "Quick Facts" section not yet added to resume page

**Recommendation:**
- Add prominent "Download Resume" button in hero section (high priority)
- Review resume page for scannability improvements
- Add "Quick Facts" section at top of resume page

### 4. **Case Studies - Missing Context** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current:** Case studies are excellent but missing:
- Company context (what is Divar? What is Setare Aval?)
- Team size/structure
- Your specific role vs. team contribution

**Recommendation:** Add brief company/context section at start of each case study

## 💡 STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. **Information Architecture - Current vs. Recommended**

**Current Flow (Implemented):**
Hero → Why Hire Me → Metrics → Case Studies → Testimonials → Contact

**Status:** ✅ **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** - Flow now includes Why Hire Me and Testimonials

**Recommended Further Improvements:**
1. ✅ **Hero** (with stronger value prop) - Partially improved
2. ✅ **Why Hire Me** (key differentiators) - Fully implemented
3. ✅ **Metrics** (quick impact stats) - Present
4. ✅ **Case Studies** (keep depth) - Present
5. ✅ **Testimonials** (social proof) - Fully implemented
6. ❌ **Skills & Tools** (NEW - dedicated section) - Not yet added
7. ✅ **Contact** (keep) - Present

**Why:** Hiring managers want to quickly assess:

2. ✅ Can they solve our problems? (Case Studies) - Present
3. ⚠️ Do they have the right experience? (Timeline) - Could be more prominent
4. ❌ Do they know our tools? (Skills) - Missing dedicated section
5. ✅ How do I contact them? (Contact) - Present

### 2. **Add Skills/Tools Section to Home Page**

**Why:** Many hiring managers check tool proficiency early

### 3. **Strengthen "Experiences" Section**

**Current:** Shows teaching and design system, but could be stronger

**Recommendation:**
- Add more context about impact
- Show how teaching/mentorship translates to leadership
- Add metrics where possible (e.g., "200+ designers → 85% job placement rate")

### 4. **Contact Page - Add "What I'm Looking For"**

**Current:** Generic "Let's Work Together" message

**Recommendation:** Add section explaining:
- Types of roles you're interested in
