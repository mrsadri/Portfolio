- **Caption**: `Celebrating the completion of a product design course at Rahnema College, Winter 2023`
- **Title**: `Teaching Product Design at Rahnema College`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This photo captures a special moment after completing a product design course at Rahnema College in winter 2023. Here I am with my students, celebrating the end of an intensive learning journey. Since then, I've been teaching product design courses seasonally at Rahnema, sharing my experience and knowledge with the next generation of designers. It's incredibly rewarding to see these students grow into successful designers who go on to make meaningful contributions to our design community. Teaching has become an important part of my professional journey—it keeps me connected to emerging talent, challenges me to articulate design principles clearly, and allows me to give back to the community that shaped my own growth.

- **Caption**: `Completing the Data Analysis Bootcamp at Rahnema College, Spring 2024`
- **Title**: `Completing the Data Analysis Bootcamp`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This polaroid captures the end of an intensive Data Analysis Bootcamp at Rahnema College in Spring 2024. What a journey it was—a 170-hour marathon that pushed me to expand my skills beyond design. The course covered data preprocessing, business metrics, statistical inference, and A/B testing, giving me tools to bridge the gap between design intuition and quantitative insights. The memories from those days are countless, but what stands out most is how this experience transformed my approach to product design. I learned to validate design decisions with data, speak the language of analytics, and create more evidence-based solutions. This bootcamp was a turning point that made me a more well-rounded designer, equipped to work effectively with data teams and make design choices backed by solid analysis.
  ```
- **Quote**: `Great design is the perfect marriage of intuition and data.`

### Memory 4: Final Evaluation Day: Data Analysis Bootcamp
- **Image**: `data-analysis-evaluation.jpg`
- **Caption**: `Final evaluation day: waiting for results at the Data Analysis Bootcamp`
- **Title**: `Final Evaluation Day: Data Analysis Bootcamp`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This photo captures the final evaluation day of the Data Analysis Bootcamp—a moment of intense anticipation. After over 10 weeks of intensive work, our code was being tested for optimal performance and efficiency. I remember the stress of that day, wondering if our solution would run correctly and meet all the requirements. But looking back, this moment represents something important: the willingness to step outside my comfort zone as a designer and embrace the uncertainty of learning something completely new. The pressure of that evaluation taught me resilience and the value of thorough preparation. More importantly, it reinforced my belief that great designers aren't afraid to learn new skills, even when it means facing moments of doubt. This experience gave me the confidence to tackle complex, data-driven design challenges with both creativity and analytical rigor.
  ```
- **Quote**: `Growth happens when we step outside our comfort zone and embrace uncertainty.`

- **Title**: `Early Days: From Intern to APM at Tiara UX Agency`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This photo takes me back to March 2018, when I was transitioning from a project management intern to an Associate Product Manager at Tiara UX Agency. This was the office where we worked on a major project for Irancell—a telecommunications company serving millions of users. What I remember most about this team was their incredible energy and dedication. We were a dynamic, hardworking group, and the project meant so much to us that we sometimes worked through the night, staying at the office until morning. Those late nights weren't just about deadlines—they were about the shared commitment to creating something meaningful for millions of users. This experience taught me early in my career that great products are built by teams who care deeply about their work, and it set the foundation for my approach to product design: combining strategic thinking with relentless execution.
  ```

### Memory 6: Exploring the Omidvar Brothers Museum
- **Image**: `omidvar-museum-visit.jpg`
- **Caption**: `Visiting the Omidvar Brothers Museum at Saadabad Palace, September 2025`
- **Title**: `Exploring the Omidvar Brothers Museum`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This photo from September 2025 captures a moment with friends exploring the Omidvar Brothers Museum at Saadabad Palace—a place filled with adventure and discovery. While this isn't directly related to my design work, it reflects something fundamental about who I am: I'm passionate about creating meaningful experiences and building communities where people can connect and interact. These friendship groups I form aren't just social—they're about bringing people together around shared interests and curiosity. The story of the Omidvar Brothers, two Iranian explorers who traveled the world documenting cultures and adventures, resonates with my own journey of exploration—both in design and in life. These experiences outside of work fuel my creativity and remind me that great design, like great adventures, comes from genuine curiosity and the willingness to explore new perspectives.
  ```
- **Quote**: `Great design, like great adventures, comes from genuine curiosity.`

### Memory 7: Building Community Through Adventure: Tochal Mountain Group
- **Image**: `tochal-mountain-group.jpeg`
- **Caption**: `Nighttime gathering at Tochal Peak with the mountaineering community, October 2022`
- **Title**: `Building Community Through Adventure: Tochal Mountain Group`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This nighttime photo from October 2022 captures one of the meaningful experiences I created outside of work: Sunday night mountaineering trips to Tochal Peak in Tehran. What started as a small group of friends has grown into a thriving community of over 500 members who gather weekly for diverse adventures. Through this group, I've met countless people and witnessed how shared experiences can build lasting connections. This reflects my core belief that great experiences—whether in design or life—emerge when we bring people together around shared passions. The view from that hilltop, with the city lights spread below us, reminds me that sometimes the best perspective comes from stepping back and seeing the bigger picture. This community-building experience has taught me valuable lessons about organizing people, creating inclusive spaces, and fostering engagement—skills that directly translate to my work in product design, where I'm constantly thinking about how to bring users together around meaningful experiences.
  ```
- **Quote**: `Great experiences emerge when we bring people together around shared passions.`

### Memory 8: Wood Carving Workshop: Lessons in Precision and Patience
- **Image**: `wood-carving-workshop.jpg`
- **Caption**: `Wood carving workshop: learning precision and patience from a master craftsman`
- **Title**: `Wood Carving Workshop: Lessons in Precision and Patience`
- **Description**:
  ```
  This photo captures a moment in a wood carving workshop where I'm learning from a master craftsman, carefully observing his technique to create a wooden bird. The pieces I crafted in this workshop—like the bird I kept for months before gifting it to a friend—became symbols of precision, attention to detail, and perseverance. Wood carving taught me that great work requires patience, the willingness to learn from masters, and the discipline to refine every detail until it's right. These lessons directly inform my approach to product design: understanding that every interaction, every pixel, and every user flow matters. The process of transforming raw wood into something beautiful through careful, deliberate work mirrors how I approach design problems—starting with rough ideas and gradually refining them through iteration and attention to detail. This craft reminds me that the best designs, like the best carvings, emerge from a combination of skill, patience, and the refusal to give up when things get challenging.
  ```
