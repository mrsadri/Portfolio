# The Loyalty Paradox: Turning Prize Hunters into Paying Users

**Role:** UX Researcher & Designer  
**Timeline:** July - August 2021  
**Impact:** 18% revenue increase, 12% growth in weekly active users

---

## The Platform

**Setare Aval** is a multi-functional payment service app in Iran, enabling users to pay bills, purchase mobile top-ups, buy internet packages, and participate in prize lotteries. Like many fintech apps in the region, it competed fiercely for user attention in a crowded marketplace.

But they had a brilliant growth strategy: **attract users with prizes, convert them into paying customers.**

Or so they thought.

---

## The Paradox

The app had a recurring pattern that puzzled everyone:

**📈 Spike in downloads before each lottery draw**  
**💸 Users make a few transactions to qualify**  
**🎁 Award ceremony happens**  
**📉 User activity plummets immediately after**

Repeat. Every. Single. Time.

Users were coming for the prizes but leaving just as quickly. The company was bleeding marketing budget on users who never converted into loyal customers.

**The challenge:** Transform superficial engagement driven by prize-seeking into genuine, sustained user loyalty.

## The Research Challenge

### Why Traditional Methods Wouldn't Work

When users uninstall an app, they're gone. You can't interview them. You can't run usability tests. And even if you could, people rarely tell you the real emotional reasons behind their decisions.

I needed a different approach.

### The Solution: Digital Archaeology

I proposed **Desk Research**—analyzing what users were already saying publicly. By examining 380 comments and tweets mentioning keywords like "prize," "lottery," and "uninstall," I could uncover the real story.

I categorized comments by user intent and personality, iteratively splitting and merging categories until clear patterns emerged.

## Meet the Users Who Left

### Shervin, 31 - The Loyal Veteran
**Personality:** Self-entitled, frustrated

> "I have been using the app for years, participating in countless lotteries and making regular transactions. Despite my loyalty, I haven't won a single prize. It feels like you only care about new users and ignore long-term users like me."

**The wound:** Years of loyalty with no recognition. Feels invisible.

---

### Hamid, 26 - The Skeptic
**Personality:** Distrustful, conspiracy-minded

> "I joined the app hoping to win something, but I can't shake the feeling that the competitions are rigged. It seems like only your relatives or insiders win the prizes, making me distrust the whole process."

**The wound:** Believes the system is fundamentally unfair.

---

### Taha, 46 - The Rolling Stone
**Personality:** Restless opportunity-seeker

> "I use various apps to participate in lotteries, constantly moving from one to another. I'm always looking for the next big opportunity to win and don't stay with any app for long."

**The wound:** No app has given him a reason to stay.

---

### Taghizadeh, 30 - The Competitor
**Personality:** Community-driven, competitive

> "I love competing and being part of the app's community. Winning isn't everything for me; it's about the thrill and excitement of the competition, much like supporting a sports team."

**The insight:** This is our ideal user—motivated by participation, not just prizes.

---

## The Real Problems

Through analyzing these user voices, three critical issues emerged:

### 1. **Trust Deficit**
Users perceived the prize system as rigged or unfair. Without transparency, no amount of marketing could build loyalty.

### 2. **Anti-Viral Behavior**
Users actively **avoided** inviting friends because they believed more participants = lower odds of winning. Our growth mechanism was working against itself.

### 3. **Feature Blindness**
Users saw Setare Aval as "just a lottery app." They had no idea about the utility features—bill payments, top-ups, internet packages—that could make the app indispensable.

**The core insight:** We were solving the wrong problem. The issue wasn't getting users to engage with lotteries. It was getting them to see value **beyond** the lotteries.

---

## Revised Strategy

### New Goals & Metrics

Instead of chasing vanity metrics, we established goals tied to real business value:

**Primary Metrics:**
1. **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** 6.2 → 8.0
2. **User Referrals:** 12% → 20% of active users inviting others
3. **First Payment by New Users:** 25% → 74% within first month

**Counter Metric:**
- Payment amount per user per month (to ensure we weren't gaming the system by splitting transactions)

---

## The Solutions

### Solution 1: Turn Users into Gift-Givers

**The Insight:** When you buy a top-up or pay someone else's bill, you're doing them a favor. What if that favor also introduced them to Setare Aval?

**The Mechanism:**

When a user purchases something for another phone number (top-up, internet package, bill payment), the recipient receives an SMS.

**Three Message Variants Tested:**

**Message A** (Control)
> "User 4675----0912 has purchased {Internet package} for you via Setare Yek app. [Setare Yek promotional text]"

**Message B** (Add Download Link)
> "User 4675----0912 has purchased {Internet package} for you via Setare Yek app. [Promotional text] Download: [Link]"

**Message C** (Add Incentive)
> "User 4675----0912 has purchased {Internet package} for you via Setare Yek app. Register and enter invite code {Code} to earn 500 points. Download: [Link]"

**The Psychology:**
- Creates obligation through reciprocity
- Leverages social proof (someone I know uses this)
- Provides immediate value (500 points)
- Makes existing users feel generous, not competitive

---

### Solution 2: Gamified Task System with Real Rewards

**The Problem with Previous Approach:**
- Users only engaged when big prizes were announced
- No ongoing reason to use utility features
- Prize system felt like gambling, not earning

**The New System:**

A weekly task-based reward system that encouraged diverse app usage:

**Task Examples:**
- Pay a utility bill → Earn points
- Buy top-up for someone else → Earn bonus points
- Make your first payment this week → Unlock multiplier

**Key Innovation:** Points weren't just for lottery entries—they could be withdrawn as real value after completing enough tasks.

---

## The Design Evolution

### First Version Problems (Discovered in Usability Testing)

❌ **Checkboxes felt clickable** - Users tried to "complete" tasks by checking them  
❌ **Progress display unclear** - "Completed: 1 of 2" didn't motivate  
❌ **Wrong emphasis** - Focused on withdrawing 1,500 points instead of earning more  
❌ **No task guidance** - Users didn't know how to complete tasks  
❌ **Unclear connection** - Link between completing tasks and activating withdrawal was confusing

### Critical Feedback from Marketing Team

> "Why limit users weekly? Why not make it incremental?"

**My Response:** Weekly resets create urgency and habit formation. If tasks accumulated indefinitely, users would procrastinate. Weekly cycles mirror natural planning rhythms (weekends, paydays) and create consistent engagement patterns.

---

### Refined Interface Design

**Key Improvements:**

**Visual Task Status**
- Replaced checkboxes with progress indicators
- Clear visual hierarchy: Incomplete → In Progress → Complete
- Direct links to relevant sections (e.g., "Pay Bill" button goes to bill payment)

**Smart Progress Display**
- Changed from "1 of 2" to visual progress bars
- Added point values clearly next to each task
- Showed total potential earnings prominently

**Motivation Architecture**
- Emphasized earning/doubling points over withdrawal
- Made "bonus" opportunities visually distinct
- Added contextual education about point value

**Guided Actions**
- Each incomplete task had a direct action button
- Contextual tooltips explaining benefits
- Preview of what unlocks after task completion

## The Results

### Measured Two Months Post-Launch

**Revenue Impact:**
- **18% increase in income** - Sustained, not temporary

**User Engagement:**
- **12% more weekly active users** - Steady growth, not spikes

**Critical Control:**
- Marketing campaigns paused for 8 weeks post-launch
- Confirmed results were from product changes, not advertising

### What Changed

**Before:** Users came for prizes, left when they didn't win  
**After:** Users stayed for utility, prizes became a bonus

**Before:** Users avoided inviting friends (competition)  
**After:** Users invited friends to share value (reciprocity)

**Before:** App was "just for lotteries"  
**After:** App became part of weekly payment routine

## What I Learned

### 1. **Listen to What Users Do, Not Just What They Say**
The 380 comments revealed emotional truths users would never admit in an interview: feeling cheated, distrustful, exploited.

### 2. **Incentives Shape Behavior**
Our lottery system inadvertently made users selfish (don't invite friends) and transactional (only engage when prizes are big). Changing incentives changed everything.

### 3. **Desk Research is Underrated**
When traditional research methods fail (uninstalled users, emotional decisions), user-generated content provides unfiltered insights.

### 4. **Gamification ≠ Games**
Early task system felt like checking boxes. Successful version felt like earning rewards through real value creation.

### 5. **Product Changes Need Protection Windows**
Pausing marketing for 8 weeks was controversial but essential. It proved our solutions worked independently of external spend.

## Reflection

This project taught me that **engagement metrics can lie**. We had engagement—lottery spikes proved that. But we didn't have loyalty.

Real loyalty comes from utility, not gimmicks. The lotteries didn't disappear—they just became what they should have been all along: a delightful bonus to an already valuable service.

By reframing prizes from "the only reason to use the app" to "a reward for using a useful app," we transformed transactional users into committed customers.
